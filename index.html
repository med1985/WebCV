	    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
	    <p>
	      I started programming in university, modelling various systems with computational simulations and high throughput analytical tools.
	      I found that it a very rewarding experience and really enjoyed the mixture of logic and creativity needed to design APIs that are
	      flexible while still maintaining some of the founding principles of modern software engineering. My motivation comes from yearning
	      for self-improvement and learning new platforms, languages and libraries. I teach myself a lot in my own time, working on several
	      opensource projects (see my pet projects section) and learning new frameworks.
