	    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
	    <div id="personal-profile">
	    <p>
	      I've found working on opensource platforms very rewarding and being involved in a community a great experience. Being a part of
	      an expansive network gives me the opportunity to learn from the experience of a broad network of people who all take a different
	      approach to solve every problem. I have been given the honour of being both an committer and PMC member to the Apache XMLGraphics
	      project and strive to give back to the community for all that I've learned and experience I've gained.
            </p>
            <p>
	      On a personal note I find software development to be a very rewarding experience and really enjoyed the mixture of logic and
	      creativity needed to design APIs that are flexible while still maintaining some of the founding principles of modern software
	      engineering. My motivation comes from yearning for self-improvement and learning new platforms, languages and libraries. I teach
	      myself a lot in my own time, working on several opensource projects (see my pet projects section) and learning new frameworks.
	      I'm a big believer that with every new language/platform you learn, you add to your repertoire of solutions to any particular
	      problem, making you a more efficient and proficient engineer.
            </p>

	      Outside of the office I love plaing sports; I regularly play rugby (flanker), football, squash and go to the gym
