       	      <p>
                Recently, I've been working predominantly on opensource platforms to streamline business processes. Being a part of an
                expansive network has given me the opportunity to learn from the experience of a broad network of people. I have been given the
                honour of committership and PMC membership to the Apache XMLGraphics project. I hope to continue to repay to the community for
                all that I've learned and experience I've gained.
              </p>
              <p>
       	        On a personal note I find software development to be a very rewarding experience and really enjoyed the mixture of logic and
       	        creativity needed to design APIs that are flexible while still maintaining some of the founding principles of modern software
       	        engineering. My motivation comes from yearning for self-improvement and learning new platforms, languages and libraries. I
                teach myself a lot in my own time, working on several opensource projects (see my pet projects section) and learning new
                frameworks. I'm a big believer that with every new language/platform you learn, you add to your repertoire of solutions to
                any particular problem, making you a more efficient and proficient engineer.
