	    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
	    <p>
	      I started programming in university, modelling various systems with computational simulations and high throughput analytical tools.
	      I found that it a very rewarding experience and really enjoyed the mixture of logic and creativity needed to design APIs that are
	      flexible while still maintaining some of the founding principles of modern software engineering. My motivation comes from yearning
	      for self-improvement and learning new platforms, languages and libraries. I teach myself a lot in my own time, working on several
	      opensource projects (see my pet projects section) and learning new frameworks.

	    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
	    <h3>Thunderhead Ltd 2010 - present</h3>
	    <p>
	      Developing on the opensource projects that support the propietary product which include Apache FOP and Apache PDFBox. This involves
	      various technologies including XML, XSLT, PDF, PostScript, AFP and the various image and font formats. I drove improvement to the
	      development process to include using Git, fully automated end-to-end testing (written in Groovy and results displayed using
	      JavaScript). The development environment was Ubuntu Linux, but also worked on Windows and other linux flavours.The projects
	      undertaken include:
	      <ul>
	       <li><div>Porting Apache FOP to be used in a SaaS/PaaS environment and to be cloud compatible</div></li>
	       <li><div>Implementing TrueType font support for the PostScript document output format</div></li>
	       <li><div>Developing on both FOP and PDFBox to allow PDFs to be used as an image format</div></li>
	       <li><div>Setting up and maintaining a Jenkins CI server</div></li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>The University of Bristol (2004-2008)</h3>
	    <p>
	      Awarded a 2.1 (Hons) MSci in Physics - thesis was to create an experimental and computation analog to model motor proteins (acto-myosin/dynein/kinesine).
